# GoalieGame
Ball Game for two Player

GoalieGame is a project for beginner to learn C#. 

We have a moving ball in the Playground (Canvas) which will be activated after pressing the Start button. 

We have two goalies which can be moved in the y-Direction. 

The right gaolie can be moved with the up and down Key Press and the left goalie with the E and D Key Press.
!!! The first Goalie move starts allways with the Up Key Press, otherwise the goalie will not move!!!
ToDo: No idea why this is like this and how to fix it.

The entering goals (hit the wall) appears as a Fail for the goalie. 

The correct hit of the ball from the goalie appears as a Point for the goalie.
